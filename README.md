## More Info

EnTuBarrio's ChatBot is a bot in charge of directing the conversation so that customers can place their orders, as the conversation progresses and if a user is new, we take the data provided from the Facebook API and by the user. This data is stored in our database and is very important for future orders because once the conversation is reduced directly to the WebView (where products are selected) of EnTuBarrio.

For the development of ChatBot we have used NodeJs, Facebook Api, DialogFlow and the webhook to redirect the calls and to be able to implement the treatment of the data, as well we make use of the structure that provides FaceBook Messenger for the frontend.
